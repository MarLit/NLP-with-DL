Assignments

Here are my solutions for the homework 1. I have two concerns:

- My q3_word2vec.py does not pass the gradient check. However, (i) All other gradient checks are okay. (ii) All my other outputs coincide with the ouputs from the solutions posted at the slack channel (they are added to my solutions for a step-by-step comparison and commented out). (iii) The output plots are okay. (iv) The implementation of the gradient checker is probably also okay (it is the only one piece I have directly borrowed from published solutions, without trying to implement it myself). What then can be wrong with the gradient check in word2vec?

- It takes about 4.5 hrs to run q3_run.py at my laptop, while the assignment says that an efficient implementation would take about 1 hr. I would appreciate very much any comments on what can be improved in my implementation.

Thank you!
